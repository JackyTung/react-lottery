# Development concept
This project is based on [my react app](https://github.com/JackyTung/my-react-app) to develop.

- Follow create-react-app, avoid to use webpack (it's to complicated)
- Easy-managed router (react-router)
- Easy-managed states, keep all data from the same source. (redux)
- Separate UI logic, data select logic (reselect) and data fetching logic.
- Handle async actions (redux-observable).
- Use third-party design system (material-UI)
- Consistent coding style (eslint, prettier)
